# US-2020-election-prediction
this project will aim at predicting the us presidential election
Your project is to develop a statistical model to predict the 2020 US presidential election. The
dataset project2020.csv on Canvas contains information on US presidential elections
from 1916 to 2016. Based on this data on the last 26 elections, three main conditions affect
voting patterns. The first is whether the president is running again. If so, this has a positive
effect on votes for the president. The other variables are based on the current state of the
economy. A good economy is positive for the incumbent party. For example, the price inflation
variable measures the GDP deflatorâ€™s growth rate in the first 15 quarters of the administration
term. The third variable is a Goodness (Z) variable, which is defined as the number of quarters
during which the GDP per capita growth has exceeded 3:2%. The slow growth of the US
economy since the financial crisis of 2008 is negative for the incumbent party.
